    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      My name is Jordan Dardar, and I’m working through CSD 340 as part of my software development degree.
      I grew up in Bentonville, Arkansas, and I still feel connected to the community there.
      I like learning by building small projects because it helps the concepts stick faster than just reading about them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of school, my life is busy in the best way because I have a fiancée and three kids.
      Most days I’m balancing family time with assignments, and that usually means working in the evenings.
      <span class="sentence">Even with a full schedule, I’m trying to stay consistent and improve a little each week.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy technology because it feels like solving puzzles that actually lead to something useful.
      Right now I’m focused on building strong fundamentals in Java, HTML, and CSS so I can create cleaner projects later.
      I’m also learning how important it is to keep code readable, not just “working.”
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my goals is to keep developing skills I can use in a real job setting, not just for class.
      I like seeing how small design choices can make a website feel easier or harder to use.
      The more I practice, the more confident I feel turning ideas into something you can actually click and use.
