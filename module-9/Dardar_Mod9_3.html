  <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

  <h2>A Short Story</h2>

  <p>
    On Saturday morning, I walked outside and realized the air felt different.
    The sky was clear, and the neighborhood was quiet in that way that makes you feel like
    something good is about to happen. I grabbed my hoodie and decided to take the long way
    down the street just to enjoy it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Halfway down the road, I heard a familiar sound coming from the park.
    A kid was laughing, a dog was running in circles, and someone was practicing a song
    that I actually recognized. It made me slow down and pay attention instead of rushing
    through everything like I normally do.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time I got home, I felt oddly refreshed. It wasn’t some huge life-changing moment,
    but it reminded me that simple things can reset your mood. That day, I decided my four
    “good things” were <span id="word1" class="blank">_____</span>,
    <span id="word2" class="blank">_____</span>,
    <span id="word3" class="blank">_____</span>, and
    <span id="word4" class="blank">_____</span>.
  </p>

  <div class="buttons">
    <button type="button" onclick="fillWord1()">Word 1</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="fillWord2()">Word 2</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="fillWord3()">Word 3</button>
    <button type="button" onclick="fillWord4()">Word 4</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    // Four JavaScript variables holding the string inputs for the span tags
    const wordOne = "peace";
    const wordTwo = "music";
    const wordThree = "laughter";
    const wordFour = "gratitude";

    function fillWord1() {
      document.getElementById("word1").textContent = wordOne;
    }

    function fillWord2() {
      document.getElementById("word2").textContent = wordTwo;
    }

    function fillWord3() {
      document.getElementById("word3").textContent = wordThree;
    }

    function fillWord4() {
      document.getElementById("word4").textContent = wordFour;
    }
  </script>

</body>
