      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        This bioSite is dedicated to my grandmother, Janet. She was born on August 12, 1944,
        and currently lives in Panama City Beach, Florida. This site highlights her life,
        interests, and the hobbies she enjoys most.
      </p>

      <p>
        Janet has always valued creativity, family, and staying active. Through this project,
        I wanted to showcase the things that make her who she is and celebrate her lifelong
        passions.
